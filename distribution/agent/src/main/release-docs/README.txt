Welcome to Apache ShardingSphere Agent
===============================================================================

Apache ShardingSphere Agent is used to collect relevant monitoring data generated when Apache ShardingSphere is running, including Loggin, Metrics, and Tracing.

- `Logging` The log can be easily expanded through the agent to provide more information for analyzing the system running status.
- `Metrics` System statistical indicators are collected through probes for display by third-party applications.
- `Tracing` Tracing data between distributed services or internal processes will be collected by agent. It will then be sent to third-party APM systems.
