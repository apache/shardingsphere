# Podling Maturity Assessment for ShardingSphere

## Overview

This is an assessment of the ShardingSphere podling’s maturity, meant to help inform the decision (of the mentors, community, Incubator PMC and ASF Board of Directors) to graduate it as a top-level Apache project.

It is based on the ASF project maturity model at https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html

| **CS20** | Decisions are made by consensus among PMC members 9 and are documented on the project's main communications channel. Community opinions are taken into account but the PMC has the final word if needed.                                                                        | **YES.** The project has been making important decisions on the mailing lists. |
| **CS30** | Documented voting rules are used to build consensus when discussion is not sufficient.                                                                                                                                                                                          | **YES.** The project uses the standard ASF voting rules. |
| **CS40** | In Apache projects, vetoes are only valid for code commits and are justified by a technical explanation, as per the Apache voting rules defined in CS30.                                                                                                                        | **YES.** The project has not used a veto at any point during incubating. |
| **CS50** | All "important" discussions happen asynchronously in written form on the project's main communications channel. Offline, face-to-face or private discussions 11 that affect the project are also documented on that channel.                                                    | **YES.** The project has been making important decisions on the project mailing lists. Minor decisions may occasionally happen during code reviews, which are also asynchronous and in written form. |
