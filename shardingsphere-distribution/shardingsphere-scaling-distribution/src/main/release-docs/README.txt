Welcome to Apache ShardingSphere
===============================================================================

ShardingSphere is an open-source ecosystem consisted of a set of distributed database middleware solutions, including 2 independent products, ShardingSphere-JDBC & ShardingSphere-Proxy. 
They both provide functions of data sharding, distributed transaction and database orchestration, applicable in a variety of situations such as Java isomorphism, heterogeneous language. 

Aiming at reasonably making full use of the computation and storage capacity of database in distributed system, ShardingSphere defines itself as a middleware, rather than a totally new type of database. 
As the cornerstone of many enterprises, relational database still takes a huge market share. 
Therefore, at current stage, we prefer to focus on its increment instead of a total overturn.

ShardingSphere-Scaling defines itself as a component to scale data nodes for ShardingSphere, providing a solution to migrate data from old ShardingSphere cluster to new clusters.

* It can be used directly as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
* Applicable to HTTP API.
