Welcome to Apache ShardingSphere
===============================================================================

Apache ShardingSphere is positioned as a Database Plus, and aims at building a standard layer and ecosystem above heterogeneous databases. 
It focuses on how to reuse existing databases and their respective upper layer, rather than creating a new database. The goal is to minimize or eliminate the challenges caused by underlying databases fragmentation.

The concepts at the core of the project are Connect, Enhance and Pluggable.

- `Connect:` Flexible adaptation of database protocol, SQL dialect and database storage. It can quickly connect applications and heterogeneous databases quickly.
- `Enhance:` Capture database access entry to provide additional features transparently, such as: redirect (sharding, readwrite-splitting and shadow), transform (data encrypt and mask), authentication (security, audit and authority), governance (circuit breaker and access limitation and analyze, QoS and observability).
- `Pluggable:` Leveraging the micro kernel and 3 layers pluggable mode, features and database ecosystem can be embedded flexibily. Developers can customize their ShardingSphere just like building with LEGO blocks.

Apache ShardingSphere including 3 independent products: JDBC, Proxy & Sidecar (Planning).
They all provide functions of data scale-out, distributed transaction and distributed governance,
applicable in a variety of situations such as Java isomorphism, heterogeneous language and Cloud-Native.

As the cornerstone of enterprises, the relational database has a huge market share. Therefore, we prefer to focus on its incrementation instead of a total overturn.

ShardingSphere-JDBC defines itself as a lightweight Java framework that provides extra services at the Java JDBC layer.
With the client end connecting directly to the database, it provides services in the form of a jar and requires no extra deployment and dependence.
It can be considered as an enhanced JDBC driver, which is fully compatible with JDBC and all kinds of ORM frameworks.

* Applicable in any ORM framework based on JDBC, such as JPA, Hibernate, Mybatis, Spring JDBC Template or direct use of JDBC;
* Supports any third-party database connection pool, such as DBCP, C3P0, BoneCP, HikariCP;
* Support any kind of JDBC standard database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLServer and any JDBC adapted databases.
