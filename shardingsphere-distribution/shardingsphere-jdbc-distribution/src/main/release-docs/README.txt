Welcome to Apache ShardingSphere
===============================================================================

ShardingSphere is an open-source ecosystem consisted of a set of distributed database middleware solutions, including 2 independent products, ShardingSphere-JDBC & ShardingSphere-Proxy. 
They both provide functions of data sharding, distributed transaction and database orchestration, applicable in a variety of situations such as Java isomorphism, heterogeneous language. 

Aiming at reasonably making full use of the computation and storage capacity of database in distributed system, ShardingSphere defines itself as a middleware, rather than a totally new type of database. 
As the cornerstone of many enterprises, relational database still takes a huge market share. 
Therefore, at current stage, we prefer to focus on its increment instead of a total overturn.

ShardingSphere-JDBC defines itself as a lightweight Java framework that provides extra service at Java JDBC layer. 
With client end connecting directly to the database, it provides service in the form of jar and requires no extra deployment and dependence. 
It can be considered as an enhanced JDBC driver, which is fully compatible with JDBC and all kinds of ORM frameworks.

* Applicable in any ORM framework based on Java, such as JPA, Hibernate, Mybatis, Spring JDBC Template or direct use of JDBC.
* Based on any third-party database connection pool, such as DBCP, C3P0, BoneCP, Druid, HikariCP.
* Support any kind of database that conforms to JDBC standard: MySQL, Oracle, SQLServer and PostgreSQL for now.
