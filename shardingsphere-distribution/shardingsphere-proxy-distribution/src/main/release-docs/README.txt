Welcome to Apache ShardingSphere
===============================================================================

ShardingSphere is an open-source ecosystem consisted of a set of distributed database middleware solutions, including 2 independent products, ShardingSphere-JDBC & ShardingSphere-Proxy. 
They both provide functions of data sharding, distributed transaction and database orchestration, applicable in a variety of situations such as Java isomorphism, heterogeneous language. 

Aiming at reasonably making full use of the computation and storage capacity of database in distributed system, ShardingSphere defines itself as a middleware, rather than a totally new type of database. 
As the cornerstone of many enterprises, relational database still takes a huge market share. 
Therefore, at current stage, we prefer to focus on its increment instead of a total overturn.

ShardingSphere-Proxy defines itself as a transparent database proxy, providing a database server that encapsulates database binary protocol to support heterogeneous languages. 
Friendlier to DBA, the MySQL/PostgreSQL version provided now can use any kind of client access (such as MySQL Command Client, MySQL Workbench, Navicat etc.) that is compatible of MySQL/PostgreSQL protocol to operate data.

* Totally transparent to applications, it can be used directly as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
* Applicable to any kind of compatible of client end that is compatible of MySQL and PostgreSQL protocol.
