/**
 * Slice response packet for Firebird.
 *
 * <p>Success response to a get slice request, carrying the requested slice of a blob.</p>
 *
 * <p>The wire protocol specification documents the second length field as "possibly a buffer?, needs verification",
 * so the slice length is written both as a bare 4-byte integer and as the length prefix of the slice data buffer.</p>
