### OVERVIEW

<hr>

Apache ShardingSphere follows Database Plus - our community's guiding development concept for creating a complete ecosystem that allows you to transform any database into a distributed database system, and easily enhance it with sharding, elastic scaling, data encryption features & more. 

It focuses on repurposing existing databases, by placing a standardized upper layer above existing and fragmented databases, rather than creating a new database. 

The goal is to provide unified database services, and minimize or eliminate the challenges caused by underlying databases' fragmentation. 
This results in applications only needing to communicate with a single standardized service.

The concepts at the core of the project are `Connect`, `Enhance` and `Pluggable`.

- `Connect:` Flexible adaptation of database protocol, SQL dialect and database storage. It can quickly connect applications and heterogeneous databases.
- `Enhance:` Capture database access entry to provide additional features transparently, such as: redirect (sharding, readwrite-splitting and shadow), transform (data encrypt and mask), authentication (security, audit and authority), governance (circuit breaker and access limitation and analyze, QoS and observability).
- `Pluggable:` Leveraging the micro kernel and 3 layers pluggable mode, features and database ecosystem can be embedded flexibly. Developers can customize their ShardingSphere just like building with LEGO blocks.

Virtually all databases are [supported](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/dev-manual/data-source/) including [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads), [Oracle Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org) or any other SQL-92 database.

ShardingSphere became an [Apache](https://apache.org/index.html#projects-list) Top-Level Project on April 16, 2020.

So far, ShardingSphere has been used by over [10,000 projects on GitHub](https://github.com/search?l=Maven+POM&q=shardingsphere+language%3A%22Maven+POM%22&type=Code).

### How it Works

<hr>

Apache ShardingSphere includes 2 independent products: JDBC & Proxy.
They all provide functions of data scale-out, distributed transaction and distributed governance, applicable in a variety of situations such as Java isomorphism, heterogeneous language and Cloud-Native.

### ShardingSphere-JDBC

<hr>

[![Maven Status](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.apache.shardingsphere/shardingsphere-jdbc.svg?color=green)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.shardingsphere/shardingsphere-jdbc)

A lightweight Java framework providing extra services at the Java JDBC layer. 
With the client end connecting directly to the database, it provides services in the form of a jar and requires no extra deployment and dependence.

:link: For more details, follow this [link to the official website](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/overview/#shardingsphere-jdbc).

### ShardingSphere-Proxy

<hr>

[![Nightly-Download](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=nightly-builds&message=download&color=orange)](https://nightlies.apache.org/shardingsphere/)
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-download-orange.svg)](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/shardingsphere/5.3.2/apache-shardingsphere-5.3.2-shardingsphere-proxy-bin.tar.gz)
[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/apache/shardingsphere-proxy.svg)](https://store.docker.com/community/images/apache/shardingsphere-proxy)

A transparent database proxy, providing a database server that encapsulates database binary protocol to support heterogeneous languages. 
Friendlier to DBAs, the MySQL and PostgreSQL version now provided can use any kind of terminal.

:link: For more details, follow this [link to the official website](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/overview/#shardingsphere-proxy).

### Hybrid Architecture

<hr>

ShardingSphere-JDBC adopts a decentralized architecture, applicable to high-performance light-weight OLTP applications developed with Java. 
ShardingSphere-Proxy provides static entry and all languages support, suitable for OLAP application and sharding databases management and operation.

Through the mixed use of ShardingSphere-JDBC & ShardingSphere-Proxy together with a unified sharding strategy by the same registry center, the ShardingSphere ecosystem can build an application system suitable to all kinds of scenarios.

:link: More details can be found following this [link to the official website](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/overview/#hybrid-architecture).
