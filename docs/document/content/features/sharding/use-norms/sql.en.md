## SQL Supporting Status

Compatible with all regular SQL when **routing to single data node**;
**The SQL routing to multiple data nodes** is pretty complex, it divides the scenarios as totally supported, experimental supported and unsupported.

### Totally Supported

Fully support DML, DDL, DCL, TCL and most regular DAL.
Support complex query with pagination, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, aggregation and table JOIN.

#### Regular Query

- SELECT Clause

```sql
SELECT select_expr [, select_expr ...] FROM table_reference [, table_reference ...]
[WHERE predicates]
[GROUP BY {col_name | position} [ASC | DESC], ...]
[ORDER BY {col_name | position} [ASC | DESC], ...]
[LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
```

- select_expr

```sql
*
| [DISTINCT] COLUMN_NAME [AS] [alias]
| (MAX | MIN | SUM | AVG)(COLUMN_NAME | alias) [AS] [alias]
| COUNT(* | COLUMN_NAME | alias) [AS] [alias]
```

- table_reference

```sql
tbl_name [AS] alias] [index_hint_list]
| table_reference ([INNER] | {LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER]) JOIN table_factor [JOIN ON conditional_expr | USING (column_list)]
```

#### Subquery

Stable supported when sharding keys are using in both subquery and outer query, and values of sharding keys are the same.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE order_id = 1) o WHERE o.order_id = 1;
```

Stable supported for subquery with [pagination](/en/features/sharding/usage-standard/pagination).

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT row_.*, rownum rownum_ FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order) row_ WHERE rownum <= ?) WHERE rownum > ?;
```

#### Sharding value in expression

Sharding value in calculated expressions will lead to full routing.

For example, if `create_time` is sharding value:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE to_date(create_time, 'yyyy-mm-dd') = '2019-01-01';
```

### Experimental Supported

Experimental support specifically refers to use of `Federation execution engine`.
The engine still in rapid development, basically available to users, but it still needs lots of optimization. 
It is an experimental product.

#### Subquery

Experimental supported when sharding keys are not using for both subquery and outer query, or values of sharding keys are not the same.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order) o;

SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order) o WHERE o.order_id = 1;

SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE order_id = 1) o;

SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE order_id = 1) o WHERE o.order_id = 2;
```

#### Join with cross databases

When tables in a join query are distributed on different database instances, sql statement will be supported by `Federation execution engine`.
Assuming that `t_order` and `t_order_item` are sharding tables with multiple data nodes, and no binding table rules are configured, `t_user` and `t_user_role` are single tables that distributed on different database instances. `Federation execution engine` can support the following commonly used join query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t_order o INNER JOIN t_order_item i ON o.order_id = i.order_id WHERE o.order_id = 1;

SELECT * FROM t_order o INNER JOIN t_user u ON o.user_id = u.user_id WHERE o.user_id = 1;

SELECT * FROM t_order o LEFT JOIN t_user_role r ON o.user_id = r.user_id WHERE o.user_id = 1;

SELECT * FROM t_order_item i LEFT JOIN t_user u ON i.user_id = u.user_id WHERE i.user_id = 1;

SELECT * FROM t_order_item i RIGHT JOIN t_user_role r ON i.user_id = r.user_id WHERE i.user_id = 1;

SELECT * FROM t_user u RIGHT JOIN t_user_role r ON u.user_id = r.user_id WHERE u.user_id = 1;
```

### Unsupported

CASE WHEN can not support as following:

* `CASE WHEN` containing sub-query
* `CASE WHEN` containing logical-table (instead of table alias)
