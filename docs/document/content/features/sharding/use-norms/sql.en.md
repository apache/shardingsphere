Since the SQL syntax is flexible and complex and distributed databases and stand-alone databases do not have identical query scenarios, SQLs incompatible with stand-alone databases are hard to avoid.

This document has listed identified supported SQL types and unsupported SQL types, trying to avoid traps for users.

It is inevitably to have some unlisted SQLs, welcome to supplement for that. We will also try to support those unavailable SQLs in future versions.

## Supported SQL

### Route to single data node

- 100% compatibleï¼ˆMySQL only, we are completing other databases).

### Route to multiple data nodes

Fully support DML, DDL, DCL, TCL and some DAL. Support pagination, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, aggregation and JOIN (does not support cross-database relevance). Here is an example of a most complex kind of DML:

- Main SELECT

```sql
SELECT select_expr [, select_expr ...] FROM table_reference [, table_reference ...]
[WHERE predicates]
[GROUP BY {col_name | position} [ASC | DESC], ...]
[ORDER BY {col_name | position} [ASC | DESC], ...]
[LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
```

- select_expr

```sql
*
| [DISTINCT] COLUMN_NAME [AS] [alias]
| (MAX | MIN | SUM | AVG)(COLUMN_NAME | alias) [AS] [alias]
| COUNT(* | COLUMN_NAME | alias) [AS] [alias]
```

- table_reference

```sql
tbl_name [AS] alias] [index_hint_list]
| table_reference ([INNER] | {LEFT|RIGHT} [OUTER]) JOIN table_factor [JOIN ON conditional_expr | USING (column_list)]
```

## Unsupported SQL

### Route to multiple data nodes

Partially support CASE WHEN
* `CASE WHEN` containing sub-query is not supported
* `CASE WHEN` containing logical-table is not supported(please use alias of table)

Do not support HAVING and UNION (ALL) 
Partly available sub-query
* If subquery contains `WHERE` condition, the sharding key must be included. If the outer query also contains the sharding key, the sharding key in subquery and outer query must be consistent.

Support not only pagination sub-query (see [pagination](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/cn/features/sharding/usage-standard/pagination) for more details), but also sub-query with the same mode. No matter how many layers are nested, ShardingSphere can parse to the first sub-query that contains data table. Once it finds another sub-query of this kind in the sub-level nested, it will directly throw a parsing exception.

For example, the following sub-query is available:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order) o;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE order_id = 1) o;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE order_id = 1) o WHERE o.order_id = 1;
```

The following sub-query is unavailable:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE product_id = 1) o;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE order_id = 1) o WHERE o.order_id = 2;
```

To be simple, through sub-query, non-functional requirements are available in most cases, such as pagination, sum count and so on; but functional requirements are unavailable for now.

Due to the restriction of merger, sub-query that contains aggregation function is unavailable for now.

Do not support SQL that contains schema, for the concept of ShardingSphere is to use multiple data source as one data source, so all the SQL visits are based on one logic schema.

### Operation for shardingColumn

ShardingColumn in expressions and functions will lead to full routing.

The following SQL is unavailable to single sharding, if `create_time` is shardingColumn:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t_order WHERE to_date(create_time, 'yyyy-mm-dd') = '2019-01-01';
```

ShardingSphere extract the value of ShardingColumn through `literal` of SQL, so ShardingSphere can not calculate the sharding value from the SQL because the data inside the expression is in database.

When shardingColumn in expressions and functions, ShardingSphere will use full routing to get results.
