## Background

Though ShardingSphere intends to be compatible with all the SQLs and stand-alone databases, the distributed style has brought more complex situations to the database. ShardingSphere wants to solve massive data OLTP problem first and complete relevant OLAP support problem little by little.

Please further read the [SQL](/en/features/sharding/use-norms/sql) type that ShardingSphere supports and does not support and problems aiming at [pagination](/en/features/sharding/use-norms/pagination), which is highly related to the performance.
