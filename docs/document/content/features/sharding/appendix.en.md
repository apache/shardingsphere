Limited supported SQL:

- When using `getGeneratedKeys` interface of JDBC specification to return auto-increment key, it is necessary to use a distributed key generator that supports auto-increment, and does not support other types of distributed key generators

Unsupported SQL:

- CASE WHEN contains sub-query
- Logical table names are used in CASE WHEN( Please use an alias)
- INSERT INTO tbl_name (col1, col2, …) SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col3 = ?（The SELECT clause does not support * and the built-in distributed primary key generator）
- REPLACE INTO tbl_name (col1, col2, …) SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE col3 = ?（The SELECT clause does not support * and the built-in distributed primary key generator）
- SELECT MAX(tbl_name.col1) FROM tbl_name (If the query column is a function expression, use the table alias instead of the table name）
