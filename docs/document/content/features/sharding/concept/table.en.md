Table is the core concept of data sharding transparently. 
There are diversified tables provided for different data sharding requirements by Apache ShardingSphere. 

## Logic Table

The logical name of the horizontal sharding databases (tables) with the same schema, it is the logical table identification in SQL.
For instance, the data of order is divided into 10 tables according to the last number of the primary key, and they are from `t_order_0` to `t_order_9`, whose logic name is `t_order`.

## Actual Table

The physical table that really exists in the horizontal sharding database, i.e., `t_order_0` to `t_order_9` in the instance above.

## Binding Table

It refers to a group of sharding tables with the same sharding rules.
When using binding tables in multi-table correlating query, you must use the sharding key for correlation, otherwise Cartesian product correlation or cross-database correlation will appear, which will affect query efficiency.
For example, `t_order` and `t_order_item` are both sharded by `order_id`, and use `order_id` to correlate, so they are binding tables with each other. 
Cartesian product correlation will not appear in the multi-tables correlating query, so the query efficiency will increase greatly.
Take this one for example, if SQL is:

```sql
SELECT i.* FROM t_order o JOIN t_order_item i ON o.order_id=i.order_id WHERE o.order_id in (10, 11);
```

When binding table relations are not configured, suppose the sharding key `order_id` routes value 10 to sharding 0 and value 11 to sharding 1, there will be 4 SQLs in Cartesian product after routing:

```sql
SELECT i.* FROM t_order_0 o JOIN t_order_item_0 i ON o.order_id=i.order_id WHERE o.order_id in (10, 11);

SELECT i.* FROM t_order_0 o JOIN t_order_item_1 i ON o.order_id=i.order_id WHERE o.order_id in (10, 11);

SELECT i.* FROM t_order_1 o JOIN t_order_item_0 i ON o.order_id=i.order_id WHERE o.order_id in (10, 11);

SELECT i.* FROM t_order_1 o JOIN t_order_item_1 i ON o.order_id=i.order_id WHERE o.order_id in (10, 11);
```

With binding table configuration and use `order_id` to correlate, there should be 2 SQLs after routing:

```sql
SELECT i.* FROM t_order_0 o JOIN t_order_item_0 i ON o.order_id=i.order_id WHERE o.order_id in (10, 11);

SELECT i.* FROM t_order_1 o JOIN t_order_item_1 i ON o.order_id=i.order_id WHERE o.order_id in (10, 11);
```

In them, since table `t_order` specifies sharding conditionsï¼Œ it will be taken by ShardingSphere as the primary table of query. 
All the route computations will only use the sharding strategy of the primary table, so sharding computation of `t_order_item` table will use the conditions of `t_order`.

## Broadcast Table

It refers to tables that exist in all sharding database sources. 
The schema and data must consist in each database. 
It can be applied to the small data volume that needs to correlate with big data tables to query, dictionary table for example.

## Single Table

It refers to only one table that exists in all sharding database sources. 
It is suitable for little data in table without sharding.
