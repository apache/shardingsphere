Unsupported SQLï¼š

- RAL and RDL operations of DistSQL are used in transactions.
- DDL statements are used in XA transactions.

Privileges required for XA transactions:

In MySQL8, you need to grant the user `XA_RECOVER_ADMIN` privilege, otherwise the XA transaction manager will report an error when executing the `XA RECOVER` statement.
