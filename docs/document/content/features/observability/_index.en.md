## Definition

Observing a cluster's operation status in order to quickly grasp the system's current status and efficiently be able to carry out maintenance work, represents a new challenge for distributed systems.

The point-to-point operation and maintenance method of logging into a specific server cannot be applied to scenarios facing a large number of distributed servers.

Telemetry of system-observable data is the recommended way of operating and maintaining distributed systems.
