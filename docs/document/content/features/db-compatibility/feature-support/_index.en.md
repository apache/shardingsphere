Apache ShardingSphere provides the ability of distributed collaboration for the database, and abstracts part of the database features to the upper layer for unified management to reduce the difficulty of users.

Therefore, for the unified provided features, the native SQL will no longer be transferred to the database, and it will be prompted that the operation is not supported.
User can use the feature provided by ShardingSphere to replace it.

This chapter has listed unsupported database features and related SQLs reference for users.

There are some unsupported SQLs maybe missing, welcome to finish them.
