SQL is the standard operation language between users and databases.
SQL Parse engine used to parse SQL into an abstract syntax tree to provide Apache ShardingSphere understand and implement the add-on features.

It supports SQL dialect for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, Oracle, openGauss and SQL that conform to the SQL92 specification.
However, due to the complexity of SQL syntax, there are still a little of SQL do not support yet.

This chapter has listed unsupported SQLs reference for users.

There are some unsupported SQLs maybe missing, welcome to finish them.
