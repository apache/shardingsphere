## Background

With the trend of database fragmentation, using multiple types of databases together has become the norm. The scenario of using one SQL dialect to access all heterogeneous databases is increasing.

## Challenges

The existence of diversified databases makes it difficult to standardize the SQL dialect accessing the database. Engineers need to use different dialects for different kinds of databases, and there is no unified query platform.

Automatically translate different types of database dialects into the dialects used by the database, so that engineers can use any database dialect to access all heterogeneous databases, which can reduce development and maintenance cost greatly.

## Goal

The goal of database gateway for Apache ShardingSphere is translating SQL automatically among various databases.

## Application Scenarios

As business scenarios and database products of enterprises become increasingly diversified, the connection between business applications and various database products becomes extremely complex. ShardingSphere database gateway can shield the connection between business applications and the underlying diversified databases. At the same time, it provides a unified access protocol and syntax system for different business scenarios, which can help enterprises quickly build a unified data access platform.
