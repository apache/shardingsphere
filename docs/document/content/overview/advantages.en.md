- Build a standard layer & ecosystem above heterogeneous databases.

Apache ShardingSphere is positioned as Database Plus and aims at building a standard layer and ecosystem above heterogeneous databases. The project focuses on how to maximize the original database computing and storage capabilities - rather than creating a new database. Placed above databases, ShardingSphere enhances database inter-compatibility and collaboration.

- Provide relational databases with expansions and enhancements.

Apache ShardingSphere is designed to fully unlock relational databases compute and storage capabilities in distributed scenarios, instead of creating an entirely new relational database. Relational databases still have a considerable market share today and are the cornerstone of the core system of enterprises. It is for such reasons that we believe that we should focus on enhancing it rather than overturning it.

- Support multistate access.

Apache ShardingSphere is an ecosystem composed of multiple access ports. By combining ShardingSphere-JDBC and ShardingSphere-Proxy, and using the same registry to configure sharding strategies, it can flexibly build application systems for various scenarios, enabling architects to adjust the system architecture for current businesses freely.
