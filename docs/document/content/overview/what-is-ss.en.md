## Definition

Apache ShardingSphere is an open source ecosystem of distributed databases, including three independent products: JDBC, Proxy & Sidecar (Planning). It adopts a plugin-oriented (or plugabble) architecture and expands the original databases' features list thanks to components. 

ShardingSphere provides many enhanced features in the form of database protocol and SQL, including data sharding, access routing, data security, etc. It supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and other data storage engines. 

The idea of the Apache ShardingSphere project is to provide an enhanced database computing service platform and then build an ecosystem around it. The project makes full use of the computing and storage capabilities of existing databases and enhances their core capabilities thanks to plugins. It can solve many digital transformation challenges faced by enterprises and empower them to accelerate digital applications.

ShardingSphere became an [Apache](https://apache.org/index.html#projects-list) Top-Level Project on April 16, 2020. You are welcome to check out the mailing list and discuss via [mail](mailto:dev@shardingsphere.apache.org).
