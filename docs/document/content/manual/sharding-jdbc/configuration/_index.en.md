## Introduction

As the core of Sharding-JDBC, configuration is the only module in Sharding-JDBC that has something to do with application developers. Configuration module is also the portal of Sharding-JDBC, through which users can fast and clearly understand the functions provided by Sharding-JDBC.

This part is a configuration manual for Sharding-JDBC, which can also be referred to as a dictionary if necessary.

Sharding-JDBC has provided 4 kinds of configuration methods for different situations. By configuration, application developers can flexibly use sharding databases with sharding tables, read-write split or the combination of both.
