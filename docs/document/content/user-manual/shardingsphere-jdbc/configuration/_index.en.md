Configuration is the only module in ShardingSphere-JDBC that interacts with application developers, 
through which developers can quickly and clearly understand the functions provided by ShardingSphere-JDBC.

This chapter is a configuration manual for ShardingSphere-JDBC, which can also be referred to as a dictionary if necessary.

ShardingSphere-JDBC has provided 4 kinds of configuration methods for different situations. 
By configuration, application developers can flexibly use data sharding, read-write splitting, consensus replication, data encryption, shadow database or the combination of them.
