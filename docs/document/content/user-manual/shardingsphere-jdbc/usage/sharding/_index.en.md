Data sharding is the basic capability of Apache ShardingSphere. 
This section uses data sharding as an example.
The usage of functions such as replica query, data encryption, shadow database is completely consistent with data sharding, as long as the corresponding rules are configured. 
Multiple rules can be appended.

Please refer to [Configuration Manual](/en/user-manual/shardingsphere-jdbc/configuration/) for more details.
