## Description

The `DROP READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE` syntax is used to drop readwrite-splitting rule for specified database

### Syntax

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Grammar" %}}
```sql
DropReadwriteSplittingRule ::=
  'DROP' 'READWRITE_SPLITTING' 'RULE' ifExists? readwriteSplittingRuleName (',' readwriteSplittingRuleName)* ('FROM' databaseName)?

ifExists ::=
  'IF' 'EXISTS'

readwriteSplittingRuleName ::=
  identifier

databaseName ::=
  identifier
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Railroad diagram" %}}
<iframe frameborder="0" name="diagram" id="diagram" width="100%" height="100%"></iframe>
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Supplement

- When `databaseName` is not specified, the default is the currently used `DATABASE`. If `DATABASE` is not used, `No database selected` will be prompted;
- `ifExists` clause is used for avoid `Readwrite-splitting rule not exists` error.

### Example

- Drop readwrite-splitting rule for specified database

```sql
DROP READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE ms_group_1 FROM readwrite_splitting_db;
```

- Drop readwrite-splitting rule for current database

```sql
DROP READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE ms_group_1;
```

- Drop readwrite-splitting rule with `ifExists` clause

```sql
DROP READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE IF EXISTS ms_group_1;
```
