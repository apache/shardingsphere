This chapter describes the syntax of DistSQL in detail, and introduces use of DistSQL with practical examples.

## Syntax Rule

In DistSQL statement, except for keywords, the input format of other elements shall conform to the following rules.

### Identifier

1. The identifier represents an object in the SQL statement, including:

- database name
- table name
- column name
- index name
- resource name
- rule name
- algorithm name

2. The allowed characters in the identifier are: [`A-Z, A-Z, 0-9, _`] (letters, numbers, underscores) and should start with a letter.
3. When keywords or special characters appear in the identifier, use the backticks (`).

### Literal

Types of literals include:

- string: enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes (")
- int: it is generally a positive integer, such as 0-9;

Note: some DistSQL syntax allows negative values. In this case, a negative sign (-) can be added before the number, such as -1.

- boolean, containing only true & false. Case insensitive.

### Special Instructions

- The `""` must be used to mark the algorithm type name when specifying a user-defined algorithm type name, for example, `NAME="AlgorithmTypeName"`

- The `""` is not necessary when specifying a ShardingSphere [Built-in algorithm](/en/user-manual/common-config/builtin-algorithm/) type name, for example, `NAME=HASH_MOD`
