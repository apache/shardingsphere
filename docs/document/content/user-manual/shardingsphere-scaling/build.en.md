## Build&Deployment

1. Execute the following command to compile and generate the ShardingSphere-Scaling binary package:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere.git；
cd shardingsphere;
mvn clean install -Prelease;
```

The binary package's directory is:`/shardingsphere-distribution/shardingsphere-scaling-distribution/target/apache-shardingsphere-${latest.release.version}-shardingsphere-scaling-bin.tar.gz`。

2. Unzip the distribution package, modify the configuration file `conf/server.yaml`, we should ensure the port does not conflict with others, and modify the resume from break-point(optional) server lists:

```
port: 8888
blockQueueSize: 10000
workerThread: 30

resumeBreakPoint:
  name: scalingJob
  registryCenter:
    type: ZooKeeper
    serverLists: localhost:2181
    props:
      retryIntervalMilliseconds: 10000
```

3. Start up ShardingSphere-Scaling:

```
sh bin/start.sh
```

4. See the log file `logs/stdout.log`，ensure startup successfully.

5. Ensure startup successfully by `curl`.

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/scaling/job/list
```

response:

```
{"success":true,"errorCode":0,"errorMsg":null,"model":[]}
```

## Shutdown ShardingSphere-Scaling
   
 ```
 sh bin/stop.sh
 ```

 The existing configuration items are as follows, We can modify them in `conf/server.yaml`：
