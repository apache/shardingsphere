Proper dependency management is crucial for building stable and maintainable applications with ShardingSphere.

This chapter provides comprehensive guidance on managing ShardingSphere dependencies in your projects, covering Maven BOM usage, version compatibility, and best practices for enterprise applications.

ShardingSphere provides multiple distribution methods to suit different integration scenarios. Understanding how to properly manage dependencies ensures version compatibility and simplifies project maintenance.

The key topics covered in this chapter include:

* **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: Centralized dependency version management for Maven projects
* **Version Compatibility**: Understanding version relationships and compatibility matrices
* **Build Tool Integration**: Configuration examples for Maven and Gradle

Whether you are starting a new project or maintaining an existing enterprise application, proper dependency management helps avoid common pitfalls such as version conflicts, dependency hell, and deployment issues.

For quick start scenarios, please refer to the [Quick Start](../../quick-start/) chapter. For detailed configuration examples, please consult the relevant sections in ShardingSphere-JDBC and ShardingSphere-Proxy.
