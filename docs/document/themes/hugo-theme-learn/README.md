## Usage

- [Visit the documentation](https://learn.netlify.com/en/)

## Download old versions (prior to 2.0.0)

If you need old version for compatibility purpose, either download [theme source code from releases](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/releases) or use the right git tag. For example, with `1.1.0`

- Direct download way: https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/archive/1.1.0.zip
- Git way:

```shell
cd themes/hugo-theme-learn
git checkout tags/1.1.0
```

For both solutions, the documentation is available at https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/releases/download/1.1.0/hugo-learn-doc-1.1.0.zip
