## GPG Settings

Please refer to [Release Guide](/en/contribute/release/).

## Apache Maven Central Repository Release

**1. Set settings.xml**

Add the following template to `~/.m2/settings.xml`, all the passwords need to be filled in after encryption. 
For encryption settings, please see [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html).

```xml
<settings>
    <servers>
      <server>
          <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
          <username> <!-- APACHE LDAP username --> </username>
          <password> <!-- APACHE LDAP encrypted password --> </password>
      </server>
      <server>
          <id>apache.releases.https</id>
          <username> <!-- APACHE LDAP username --> </username>
          <password> <!-- APACHE LDAP encrypted password --> </password>
      </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

**2. Update Release Notes And Example Version**

Update the following file in master branch, and submit a PR to master branch:

```
https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere-elasticjob/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md
```

Update the POM of the module `examples`, changing the version from ${CURRENT.VERSION} to ${RELEASE.VERSION}.

**3. Create Release Branch**

Suppose ElasticJob source codes downloaded from github is under `~/elasticjob/` directory and the version to be released is `${RELEASE.VERSION}`. 
Create `${RELEASE.VERSION}-release` branch, where all the following operations are performed.

```shell
## ${name} is the properly branch, e.g. master, dev-4.x
git clone --branch ${name} https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere-elasticjob.git ~/elasticjob
cd ~/elasticjob/
git pull
git checkout -b ${RELEASE.VERSION}-release
git push origin ${RELEASE.VERSION}-release
```

**4. Pre-Release Check**

```shell
mvn release:prepare -Prelease -Darguments="-DskipTests" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DdryRun=true -Dusername=${Github username}
```

-Prelease: choose release profile, which will pack all the source codes and jar files.

-DautoVersionSubmodules=true: it can make the version number is inputted only once and not for each sub-module.

-DdryRun=true: rehearsal, which means not to generate or submit new version number and new tag.

**5. Prepare for the Release**

First, clean local pre-release check information.

```shell
mvn release:clean
```

```shell
mvn release:prepare -Prelease -Darguments="-DskipTests" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DpushChanges=false -Dusername=${Github username}
```

It is basically the same as the previous rehearsal command, but deleting -DdryRun=true parameter.

-DpushChanges=false: do not submit the edited version number and tag to Github automatically.

After making sure there is no mistake in local files, submit them to GitHub.

```shell
git push origin ${RELEASE.VERSION}-release
git push origin --tags
```

**6. Deploy the Release**

```shell
mvn release:perform -Prelease -Darguments="-DskipTests" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Dusername=${Github username}
```

After that command is executed, the version to be released will be uploaded to Apache staging repository automatically. 
Visit [https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories](https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories) and use Apache LDAP account to log in; then you can see the uploaded version, the content of `Repository` column is the ${STAGING.REPOSITORY}. 
Click `Close` to tell Nexus that the construction is finished, because only in this way, this version can be usable. 
If there is any problem in gpg signature, `Close` will fail, but you can see the failure information through `Activity`.

## Apache SVN Repository Release

**1. Checkout ShardingSphere Release Directory**

If there is no local work directory, create one at first.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/ss_svn/dev/
cd ~/ss_svn/dev/
```

After the creation, checkout ShardingSphere release directory from Apache SVN.

```shell
svn --username=${APACHE LDAP username} co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/shardingsphere
cd ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere
```

**2. Add gpg Public Key**

Only the account in its first deployment needs to add that. 
It is alright for `KEYS` to only include the public key of the deployed account.

```shell
gpg -a --export ${GPG username} >> KEYS
```

**3. Add the Release Content to SVN Directory**

Create folder by version number.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cd ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
```

Add source code packages and binary packages to SVN working directory.

```shell
cp -f ~/elasticjob/elasticjob-distribution/elasticjob-src-distribution/target/*.zip ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/elasticjob/elasticjob-distribution/elasticjob-src-distribution/target/*.zip.asc ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/elasticjob/elasticjob-distribution/elasticjob-lite-distribution/target/*.tar.gz ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/elasticjob/elasticjob-distribution/elasticjob-lite-distribution/target/*.tar.gz.asc ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/elasticjob/elasticjob-distribution/elasticjob-cloud-executor-distribution/target/*.tar.gz ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/elasticjob/elasticjob-distribution/elasticjob-cloud-executor-distribution/target/*.tar.gz.asc ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/elasticjob/elasticjob-distribution/elasticjob-cloud-scheduler-distribution/target/*.tar.gz ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/elasticjob/elasticjob-distribution/elasticjob-cloud-scheduler-distribution/target/*.tar.gz.asc ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
```

**4. Generate sign files**

```shell
shasum -a 512 apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-src.zip > apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-src.zip.sha512
shasum -b -a 512 apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-lite-bin.tar.gz > apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-lite-bin.tar.gz.sha512
shasum -b -a 512 apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-executor-bin.tar.gz > apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-executor-bin.tar.gz.sha512
shasum -b -a 512 apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-scheduler-bin.tar.gz > apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-scheduler-bin.tar.gz.sha512
```

**5. Commit to Apache SVN**

```shell
svn add *
svn --username=${APACHE LDAP username} commit -m "release elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}"
```

## Check Release

**Check sha512 hash**

```shell
shasum -c apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-src.zip.sha512
shasum -c apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-lite-bin.tar.gz.sha512
shasum -c apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-executor-bin.tar.gz.sha512
shasum -c apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-scheduler-bin.tar.gz.sha512
```

**Check gpg Signature**

First, import releaser's public key. Import KEYS from SVN repository to local. (The releaser does not need to import again; the checking assistant needs to import it, with the user name filled as the releaser's. )

```shell
curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/shardingsphere/KEYS >> KEYS
gpg --import KEYS
gpg --edit-key "${GPG username of releaser}"
  > trust

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5

  > save
```

Then, check the gpg signature.

```shell
gpg --verify apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-src.zip.asc apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-src.zip
gpg --verify apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-lite-bin.tar.gz.asc apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-lite-bin.tar.gz
gpg --verify apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-executor-bin.tar.gz.asc apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-executor-bin.tar.gz
gpg --verify apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-scheduler-bin.tar.gz.asc apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-scheduler-bin.tar.gz
```

**Check Released Files**

**Compare release source with github tag**

```
curl -Lo tag-${RELEASE.VERSION}.zip https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere-elasticjob/archive/${RELEASE.VERSION}.zip
unzip tag-${RELEASE.VERSION}.zip
unzip apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-src.zip
diff -r apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-src-release shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}
```

**Check source package**

*   Check whether source tarball is oversized for including nonessential files
*   `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files exist
*   Correct year in `NOTICE` file
*   There is only text files but no binary files
*   All source files have ASF headers
*   Codes can be compiled and pass the unit tests (./mvnw install)
*   Check if there is any extra files or folders, empty folders for example

**Check binary packages**

Decompress `apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-lite-bin.tar.gz`, `apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-executor-bin.tar.gz`
and `apache-shardingsphere-elasticjob-${RELEASE.VERSION}-cloud-scheduler-bin.tar.gz`
to check the following items:

*   `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files exist
*   Correct year in `NOTICE` file
*   All text files have ASF headers
*   Check the third party dependency license:
    *   The software have a compatible license
    *   All software licenses mentioned in `LICENSE`
    *   All the third party dependency licenses are under `licenses` folder
    *   If it depends on Apache license and has a `NOTICE` file, that `NOTICE` file need to be added to `NOTICE` file of the release
