## GPG Settings

Please refer to [Release Guide](/en/contribute/release/).

## Apache Maven Central Repository Release

**1. Set settings.xml**

Add the following template to `~/.m2/settings.xml`, all the passwords need to be filled in after encryption. 
For encryption settings, please see [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html).

```xml
<settings>
    <servers>
      <server>
          <id>apache.snapshots.https</id>
          <username> <!-- APACHE LDAP username --> </username>
          <password> <!-- APACHE LDAP encrypted password --> </password>
      </server>
      <server>
          <id>apache.releases.https</id>
          <username> <!-- APACHE LDAP username --> </username>
          <password> <!-- APACHE LDAP encrypted password --> </password>
      </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

**2. Update Release Notes**

```
https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere-ui/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES.md
```

**3. Create Release Branch**

Suppose ShardingSphere source codes downloaded from github is under `~/shardingsphere-ui/` directory and the version to be released is `${RELEASE.VERSION}`. 
Create `${RELEASE.VERSION}-release` branch, where all the following operations are performed.

```shell
## ${name} is the properly branch, e.g. master, dev-4.x
git clone --branch ${name} https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere-ui.git ~/shardingsphere-ui
cd ~/shardingsphere-ui/
git pull
git checkout -b ${RELEASE.VERSION}-release
git push origin ${RELEASE.VERSION}-release
```

**4. Pre-Release Check**

```shell
cd ~/shardingsphere-ui
mvn release:prepare -Prelease -Darguments="-DskipTests" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DdryRun=true -Dusername=${Github username}
```

-Prelease: choose release profile, which will pack all the source codes, jar files and executable binary packages of ShardingSphere-UI.

-DautoVersionSubmodules=true: it can make the version number is inputted only once and not for each sub-module.

-DdryRun=true: rehearsal, which means not to generate or submit new version number and new tag.

**5. Prepare for the Release**

First, clean local pre-release check information.

```shell
cd ~/shardingsphere-ui
mvn release:clean
```

Then, prepare to execute the release.

```shell
cd ~/shardingsphere-ui
mvn release:prepare -Prelease -Darguments="-DskipTests" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DpushChanges=false -Dusername=${Github username}
```

It is basically the same as the previous rehearsal command, but deleting -DdryRun=true parameter.

-DpushChanges=false: do not submit the edited version number and tag to Github automatically.

After making sure there is no mistake in local files, submit them to GitHub.

```shell
git push origin ${RELEASE.VERSION}-release
git push origin --tags
```

**6.Deploy the Release**

```shell
cd ~/shardingsphere-ui
mvn release:perform -Prelease -Darguments="-DskipTests" -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Dusername=${Github username}
```

## Apache SVN Repository Release

**1. Checkout ShardingSphere Release Directory**

If there is no local work directory, create one at first.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/ss_svn/dev/
cd ~/ss_svn/dev/
```

After the creation, checkout ShardingSphere release directory from Apache SVN.

```shell
svn --username=${APACHE LDAP username} co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/shardingsphere
cd ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere
```

**2. Add gpg Public Key**

Only the account in its first deployment needs to add that. 
It is alright for `KEYS` to only include the public key of the deployed account.

```shell
gpg -a --export ${GPG username} >> KEYS
```

**3. Add the Release Content to SVN Directory**

Create folder by version number.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cd ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}
```

Add source code packages, binary packages and executable binary packages of ShardingSphere-Proxy to SVN working directory.

```shell
cp -f ~/shardingsphere-ui/shardingsphere-ui-distribution/shardingsphere-ui-src-distribution/target/*.zip ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/shardingsphere-ui/shardingsphere-ui-distribution/shardingsphere-ui-src-distribution/target/*.zip.asc ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/shardingsphere-ui/shardingsphere-ui-distribution/shardingsphere-ui-bin-distribution/target/*.tar.gz ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}
cp -f ~/shardingsphere-ui/shardingsphere-ui-distribution/shardingsphere-ui-bin-distribution/target/*.tar.gz.asc ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}
```

**4. Generate sign files**

```shell
shasum -a 512 apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-src.zip > apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-src.zip.sha512
shasum -b -a 512 apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-bin.tar.gz > apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-bin.tar.gz.sha512
```
**5. Commit to Apache SVN**

```shell
cd ~/ss_svn/dev/shardingsphere/
svn add shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}
svn --username=${APACHE LDAP 用户名} commit -m "release shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}"
```

## Check Release

**Check sha512 hash**

```shell
shasum -c apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-src.zip.sha512
shasum -c apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-bin.tar.gz.sha512
```

**Check gpg Signature**

First, import releaser's public key. 
Import KEYS from SVN repository to local. (The releaser does not need to import again; the checking assistant needs to import it, with the user name filled as the releaser's. )

```shell
curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/shardingsphere/KEYS >> KEYS
gpg --import KEYS
gpg --edit-key "${GPG username of releaser}"
  > trust

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5

  > save
```

Then, check the gpg signature.

```shell
gpg --verify apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-src.zip.asc apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-src.zip
gpg --verify apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-bin.tar.gz.asc apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-bin.tar.gz
```

**Check Released Files**

**Compare release source with github tag**

```
curl -Lo tag-${RELEASE.VERSION}.zip https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere-ui/archive/${RELEASE.VERSION}.zip
unzip tag-${RELEASE.VERSION}.zip
unzip apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-src.zip
diff -r apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-src shardingsphere-shardingsphere-ui-${RELEASE.VERSION}
```

**Check source package**

*   Check whether source tarball is oversized for including nonessential files
*   `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files exist
*   Correct year in `NOTICE` file
*   There is only text files but no binary files
*   All source files have ASF headers
*   Codes can be compiled and pass the unit tests (./mvnw install)
*   Check if there is any extra files or folders, empty folders for example

**Check binary packages**

Decompress `apache-shardingsphere-${RELEASE.VERSION}-shardingsphere-ui-bin.tar.gz`
to check the following items:

*   `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files exist
*   Correct year in `NOTICE` file
*   All text files have ASF headers
*   Check the third party dependency license:
    *   The software have a compatible license
    *   All software licenses mentioned in `LICENSE`
    *   All the third party dependency licenses are under `licenses` folder
    *   If it depends on Apache license and has a `NOTICE` file, that `NOTICE` file need to be added to `NOTICE` file of the release

Announcement e-mail template:

Title:

```
[ANNOUNCE] Apache ShardingSphere UI ${RELEASE.VERSION} available
```

Body:

```
Hi all,

Apache ShardingSphere Team is glad to announce the new release of Apache ShardingSphere UI ${RELEASE.VERSION}.

ShardingSphere is an open-source ecosystem consisted of a set of distributed database middleware solutions, including 2 independent products, ShardingSphere-JDBC & ShardingSphere-Proxy. 
They both provide functions of data sharding, distributed transaction and database governance, applicable in a variety of situations such as Java isomorphism, heterogeneous language. 
Aiming at reasonably making full use of the computation and storage capacity of the database in a distributed system, ShardingSphere defines itself as a middleware, rather than a totally new type of database. 
As the cornerstone of many enterprises, relational database still takes a huge market share. 
Therefore, at the current stage, we prefer to focus on its increment instead of a total overturn.
