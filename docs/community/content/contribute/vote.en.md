Title Invitation to become ShardingSphere committer: (nominee)

Content:

Hello (nominee),

The ShardingSphere Project Management Committee (PMC) hereby offers you committer privileges to the project. These privileges are offered on the understanding that you'll use them reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust
rather than unnecessary constraints.
Being a committer enables you to more easily make changes without needing to go through the patch submission process.
Being a committer does not require you to participate any more than you already do. It does tend to make one even more committed.  You will probably find that you spend more time here.
Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a contributor, participating as you do now.
A. This personal invitation is a chance for you to accept or decline in private.  Either way, please let us know in reply to the private@shardingsphere.apache.org 
address only.
B. If you accept, the next step is to register an iCLA:
    1. Details of the iCLA and the forms are found through this link: http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

    2. Instructions for its completion and return to the Secretary of the ASF are found at http://www.apache.org/licenses/#submitting

    3. When you transmit the completed iCLA, request to notify the Apache ShardingSphere and choose a unique Apache id. Look to see if your preferred id is already taken at http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html        
This will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC when your iCLA has been recorded.
When recording of your iCLA is noticed, you will receive a follow-up message with the next steps for establishing you as a committer.

Best wishes,
(PMC)

```
**5. Nominee replies the invitation, including content like accept the offer and give thanks.**

**6. PMC replies the email.**
```
Hi (nominee),

Welcome! Here are the next steps. After that we will make an announcement to the shardingsphere-dev list.

You need to send a Contributor License Agreement to the ASF. Normally you would send an Individual CLA. If you also make contributions done in work time or using work resources then see the Corporate CLA. Ask us if you have any issues. 
http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

You need to choose a preferred ASF user name and alternatives. In order to ensure it is available you can view a list of taken ids at
http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html
Please notify us when you have submitted the CLA and by what means you did so. This will enable us to monitor its progress.

We will arrange for your Apache user account when the CLA has been recorded.

After that is done, please make follow-up replies to the shardingsphere-dev list. We generally discuss everything there and keep the private@shardingsphere.apache.org list for occasional matters which must be private.

The developer section of the website describes the roles and provides other resources:
http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
http://www.apache.org/dev/

The incubator also has some useful information for new committers in incubating projects:
http://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html

Just as before you became a committer, participation in any ASF community requires adherence to the ASF Code of Conduct:
https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html

Here is the guideline for all of the ShardingSphere committers:
https://shardingsphere.apache.org/community/en/contribute/committer/
```
**7. New committer signs iCLA, this step refers to [Sign ICLA Guide](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/community/en/contribute/icla/).**

**8. New committer waits for secretary to create a new account.**

**9. PMC adds new committer in [roster](https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/shardingsphere).**

**10. New committer could setup an account, refers to [apache setup](https://gitbox.apache.org/setup/).**

**11. PMC announces new committer in the community.**  

```
To: dev@shardingsphere.apache.org

Title: [ANNOUNCE] New committer: (nominee)
