## Committer Rights

Every Apache Committer is eligible for a free license that grants them access to all the JetBrains IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and other desktop tools.

### Get free JetBrains license

If you are an Apache ShardingSphere Committer and still havenâ€™t received a free JetBrains license, please use your @apache.org email address to **[get a free All Products Pack now](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/apache?product=ALL)** for the subsequent development of ShardingSphere.

### Reactivate expired JetBrains license

If you have obtained a free JetBrains subscription but it has expired, you can reactivate all product packs for free using your @apache.org email address **[by this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/apache?product=ALL)** and click 'Refresh license list' in your JetBrains desktop tools (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) to refresh the subscription.
