## Committer Rights

For a long time, JetBrains has been committed to supporting open source development. JetBrains is now officially a Platinum Targeted Sponsor of The Apache Software Foundation! Every Apache Committer is eligible for a complimentary subscription that grants them access to all the JetBrains IDEs such as IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and other desktop tools.

All individual Committers who have received a free JetBrains license before will have their subscriptions co-termed under the official Apache Software Foundation account and extended for a year. Plus, all further renewals will be automated, so new Apache Committers will only need to request a free All Products Pack once.

By all means, if you are an Apache Committer and still havenâ€™t received a free JetBrains subscription, please use your @apache.org email address to [get a free All Products Pack now](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/apache?product=ALL).

If you have obtained a free JetBrains subscription but it has expired, you can re-subscribe all product packs for free using your @apache.org email address [by this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/apache?product=ALL) and click 'Refresh license list' in your JetBrains desktop tools (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) to refresh the subscription.
