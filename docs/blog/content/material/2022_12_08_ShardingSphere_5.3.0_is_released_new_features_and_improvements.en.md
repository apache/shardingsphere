After 1.5 months in development, [Apache ShardingSphere 5.3.0](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/downloads/) is released. Our community merged [687 PRs](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/pulls?q=is%3Amerged+is%3Apr+milestone%3A5.3.0) from contributors around the world.

The new release has been improved in terms of features, performance, testing, documentation, examples, etc.

The 5.3.0 release brings the following highlights:

- Support fuzzy query for CipherColumn.
- Support Datasource-level heterogeneous database.
- Support checkpoint resume for data consistency check.
- Automatically start a distributed transaction, while executing DML statements across multiple shards.

Additionally, release 5.3.0 also brings the following adjustments:

- Remove the Spring configuration.
- Systematically refactor the DistSQL syntax.
- Refactor the configuration format of ShardingSphere-Proxy.

# Highlights

## **1. Support fuzzy query for CipherColumn**

In previous versions, ShardingSphere's Encrypt feature didn't support the use of the `LIKE` operator in SQL.

For a while users strongly requested adding the `LIKE` operator to the Encrypt feature. Usually, encrypted fields are mainly of the string type, and it is a common practice for the string to execute `LIKE`.

To minimize friction in accessing the Encrypt feature, our community has initiated a discussion about the implementation of encrypted `LIKE`.

Since then, we've received a lot of feedback.

Some community members even contributed their original encryption algorithm implementation supporting fuzzy queries after fully investigating conventional solutions.

ðŸ”— **The relevant issue can be found** [**here**](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/issues/20435)**.**

ðŸ”— **For the algorithm design, please refer to the** [**attachment**](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/files/9684570/default.pdf) **within the** [**issue**](https://github.com/apache/shardingsphere/files/9684570/default.pdf)**.**

The [single-character abstract algorithm] contributed by the community members is implemented as `CHAR_DIGEST_LIKE` in the ShardingSphere encryption algorithm SPI.

## 2. Support datasource-level heterogeneous database

[ShardingSphere](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/) supports a database gateway, but its heterogeneous capability is limited to the logical database in previous versions. This means that all the data sources under a logical database must be of the same database type.

This new release supports datasource-level heterogeneous databases at the kernel level. This means the datasources under a logical database can be different database types, allowing you to use different databases to store data.

Combined with ShardingSphere's SQL dialect conversion capability, this new feature significantly enhances ShardingSphere's heterogeneous data gateway capability.

## 3. Data migration: support checkpoint resume for data consistency check

Data consistency checks happen at the later stage of data migration.

Previously, the data consistency check was triggered and stopped by [DistSQL](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/5.1.0/en/concepts/distsql/). If a large amount of data was migrated and the data consistency check was stopped for any reason, the check would've had to be started again â€” which is sub-optimal and affects user experience.

ShardingSphere 5.3.0 now supports checkpoint storage, which means data consistency checks can be resumed from the checkpoint.

For example, if data is being verified during data migration and the user stops the verification for some reason, with the verification progress `(finished_percentage)` being 5%, then:

```mysql
mysql> STOP MIGRATION CHECK 'j0101395cd93b2cfc189f29958b8a0342e882';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.12 sec)
mysql> SHOW MIGRATION CHECK STATUS 'j0101395cd93b2cfc189f29958b8a0342e882';
+--------+--------+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+------------------+---------------+
| tables | result | finished_percentage | remaining_seconds | check_begin_time        | check_end_time          | duration_seconds | error_message |
+--------+--------+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+------------------+---------------+
| sbtest | false  | 5                   | 324               | 2022-11-10 19:27:15.919 | 2022-11-10 19:27:35.358 | 19               |               |
+--------+--------+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+------------------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```

In this case, the user restarts the data verification. But the work does not have to restart from the beginning. The verification progress `(finished_percentage)` remains at 5%.

```mysql
mysql> START MIGRATION CHECK 'j0101395cd93b2cfc189f29958b8a0342e882';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.35 sec)
mysql> SHOW MIGRATION CHECK STATUS 'j0101395cd93b2cfc189f29958b8a0342e882';
+--------+--------+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| tables | result | finished_percentage | remaining_seconds | check_begin_time        | check_end_time | duration_seconds | error_message |
+--------+--------+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
| sbtest | false  | 5                   | 20                | 2022-11-10 19:28:49.422 |                | 1                |               |
+--------+--------+---------------------+-------------------+-------------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
```

**Limitation:** this new feature is unavailable with the `CRC32_MATCH` algorithm because the algorithm calculates all data at once.

## 4. Automatically start a distributed transaction while executing DML statements across multiple shards

Previously, even with XA and other distributed transactions configured, ShardingSphere could not guarantee the atomicity of DML statements that are routed to multiple shards â€” if users didn't manually enable the transaction.

Take the following SQL as an example:

```sql
insert into account(id, balance, transaction_id) values
(1, 1, 1),(2, 2, 2),(3, 3, 3),(4, 4, 4),
(5, 5, 5),(6, 6, 6),(7, 7, 7),(8, 8, 8);
```

When this SQL is sharded according to `id mod 2`, the ShardingSphere kernel layer will automatically split it into the following two SQLs and route them to different shards respectively for execution:

```sql
insert into account(id, balance, transaction_id) values
(1, 1, 1),(3, 3, 3),(5, 5, 5),(7, 7, 7);
insert into account(id, balance, transaction_id) values
(2, 2, 2),(4, 4, 4),(6, 6, 6),(8, 8, 8);
```

If the user does not manually start the transaction, and one of the sharded SQL fails to execute, the atomicity cannot be guaranteed because the successful operation cannot be rolled back.

ShardingSphere 5.3.0 is optimized in terms of distributed transactions. If distributed transactions are configured in ShardingSphere, they can be automatically started when DML statements are routed to multiple shards. This way, we can ensure atomicity when executing DML statements.

# Significant Adjustments

**1. Remove Spring configuration**

In earlier versions, [ShardingSphere-JDBC](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/overview/#shardingsphere-jdbc) provided services in the format of DataSource. If you wanted to introduce ShardingSphere-JDBC without modifying the code in the [Spring](https://spring.io/)/[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project, you needed to use modules such as Spring/[Spring Boot Starter](https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-boot-starters) provided by ShardingSphere.

Although ShardingSphere supports multiple configuration formats, it also has the following problems:

1. When API changes, many config files need to be adjusted, which is a heavy workload.
2. The community has to maintain multiple config files.
3. The lifecycle management of [Spring bean](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-bean) is susceptible to other dependencies of the project such as PostProcessor failure.
4. Spring Boot Starter and Spring NameSpace are affected by Spring, and their configuration styles are different from YAML.
5. Spring Boot Starter and Spring NameSpace are affected by the version of Spring. When users access them, the configuration may not be identified and dependency conflicts may occur. For example, Spring Boot versions 1.x and 2.x have different configuration styles.

[ShardingSphere 5.1.2 first supported the introduction of ShardingSphere-JDBC in the form of JDBC Driver](https://medium.com/codex/shardingsphere-jdbc-driver-released-a-jdbc-driver-that-requires-no-code-modifications-5464c30bcd64?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------). That means applications only need to configure the Driver provided by ShardingSphere at the JDBC URL before accessing to ShardingSphere-JDBC.

Removing the Spring configuration simplifies and unifies the configuration mode of ShardingSphere. This adjustment not only simplifies the configuraiton of ShardingSphere when using different configuration modes, but also reduces maintenance work for the ShardingSphere community.

**2. Systematically refactor the DistSQL syntax**

One of the characteristics of Apache ShardingSphere is its flexible rule configuration and resource control capability.

[DistSQL (Distributed SQL)](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/5.1.0/en/concepts/distsql/) is ShardingSphere's SQL-like operating language. It's used the same way as standard SQL, and is designed to provide incremental SQL operation capability.

ShardingSphere 5.3.0 systematically refactors DistSQL. The community redesigned the syntax, semantics and operating procedure of DistSQL. The new version is more consistent with ShardingSphere's design philosophy and focuses on a better user experience.

Please refer to the [latest ShardingSphere documentation](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/) for details. A DistSQL roadmap will be available soon, and you're welcome to leave your feedback.

**3. Refactor the configuration format of** [**ShardingSphere-Proxy**](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/quick-start/shardingsphere-proxy-quick-start/)

In this update, ShardingSphere-Proxy has adjusted the configuration format and reduced config files required for startup.

`server.yaml` before refactoring:

```yaml
rules:
  - !AUTHORITY
    users:
      - root@%:root
      - sharding@:sharding
    provider:
      type: ALL_PERMITTED
  - !TRANSACTION
    defaultType: XA
    providerType: Atomikos
  - !SQL_PARSER
    sqlCommentParseEnabled: true
    sqlStatementCache:
      initialCapacity: 2000
      maximumSize: 65535
    parseTreeCache:
      initialCapacity: 128
      maximumSize: 1024
```

`server.yaml` after refactoring:

```yaml
authority:
  users:
    - user: root@%
      password: root
    - user: sharding
      password: sharding
  privilege:
    type: ALL_PERMITTED
transaction:
  defaultType: XA
  providerType: AtomikossqlParser:
  sqlCommentParseEnabled: true
  sqlStatementCache:
    initialCapacity: 2000
    maximumSize: 65535
  parseTreeCache:
    initialCapacity: 128
    maximumSize: 1024
```

In ShardingSphere 5.3.0, `server.yaml` is no longer required to start Proxy. If no config file is provided by default, Proxy provides the default account root/root.

ShardingSphere is completely committed to becoming cloud native. Thanks to DistSQL, ShardingSphere-Proxy's config files can be further simplified, which is more friendly to container deployment.
