## Would you like to become an Apache committer

### What is the Apache Software Foundation？

The Apache Software Foundation (Apache Software Foundation) is the most influential non-profit open source software project organization today. It was formally established in 1999 and is mainly composed of groups of developers and users. Under the leadership of the Apache Software Foundation, more than 350 top open source projects have graduated, including Apache HTTP Server, the world's most famous web server software. Adhering to the spirit of "openness, innovation and community", many Apache projects have established a strong and successful ecosystem, and the community is full of vitality.

In addition to many projects that are very influential in the field of information technology, the Apache License (Apache License), Apache Contributor Agreement License (CLAs), and the open cooperation model (Apache Way) also have outstanding contributions in the industry and their influence far beyond the Apache Software Foundation.

The Apache Software Foundation is now the cornerstone of the modern open source software ecosystem.
