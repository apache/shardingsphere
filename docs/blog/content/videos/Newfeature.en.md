The first version of Apache ShardingSphere 5.x will be released soon. In version 5.x, Apache ShardingSphere has made significant innovations from architecture design to product scope. Apache ShardingSphere 5.x follow pluggable architecture design concept to build a flexible, embeddable and extensible project. Apache ShardingSphere 5. X no longer takes data sharding as kernel, but turns to building distributed database ecosystem. In the new version, core functions such as data sharding, distributed transaction and database governance are completely separated from the kernel and become a part of its pluggable component. Through SPI, the ecosystem is fully opened, and the functions of data migration, elastic scheduling, data encryption, shadow table are fully integrated into the product ecology. This presentation will comprehensively introduce the new features of Apache ShardingSphere 5.x.
