You can report a bug, submit a new function enhancement recommendation, or submit a development patch about the content above directly.

## Submit an Issue

 - Before submitting an issue, please go through a comprehensive search to make sure the problem cannot be solved just by searching.
 - Check the [Issue List](https://github.com/sharding-sphere/sharding-sphere/issues) to make sure the problem is not repeated.
 - [Create](https://github.com/sharding-sphere/sharding-sphere/issues/new) a new issue.
 - Define the issue with a clear and descriptive title.
 - If what you submit is a bug, please try to provide the following information:
       - Detailed descriptions about the procedures to reproduce it, including the SQL used, configuration, the expected result, the actual result and detailed TRACE log.
       - ShardingSphere and the operating system version.
       - Demo codes to reproduce the problem on github.
       - Full stack log if exception thrown.
       - Screenshot or animated gif, if possible, to help in demonstrating the problem production procedure.
       - Profile screenshot of CPU, memory or network disk IO, if performance problem concerned.
 - If what you submit is a recommendation, please try to provide the following information:
       - Detailed descriptions of the behavior mode of enhancement function.
       - Explanations for why this function is useful to most users, because a new function should be generally applicable.
       - Similar functions that other database middleware already have, if possible, from both open source software and business software.
       - Assign appropriate labels after submitting an issue, such as bug, enhancement, discussion, etc.
       - Please stay focused on the submitted issue and provide further necessary information.
       - Please close the solved issue. If you do not do that in time, we will close it after 7 days.
       - Please reopen the issue closed previously, if it has new progress. Please notice that, you have only the right to reopen the issue closed by yourself, but not the one expired and shut down by us.

## Submit Pull Request

 - Please choose the issue to be edited. If it is a new issue discovered or a new function enhancement to offer, please create an issue and set the right label for it.
 - After choosing the relevant issue, please reply with a deadline to indicate that you are working on it.
 - Find a mentor from the [Developer List](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/shardingsphere.html) and he/she will give you feedback about the design and the implementation of function in time.
 - Fork a branch to your own repo to work.
 - Please obey the [Code of Conduct](/en/contribute/code-conduct/) during the process of development and finish the check before submitting the pull request.
 - Send a pull request to the dev branch rather than the master branch of shardingsphere after it is finished.
 - The mentor will do code review before discussing some details (including the design, the implementation and the performance) with you. The request will be merged into the branch of current development version after the edit is well enough.
 - At last, congratulate to be an official contributor of ShardingSphere!
